Feeling a bit insecure about everything at the moment, but working hard to build a solid foundation in computer science. 
Currently learning <b>C</b>, <b>computer networking</b>, <b>data structures and algorithms</b>, <b>Linux</b>, <b>distributed systems</b>, and also <b>math</b>.

On the bright side, I'm a senior <b>TypeScript developer</b> with plenty of experience in web development.
